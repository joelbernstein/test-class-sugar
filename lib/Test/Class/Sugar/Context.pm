=head1 NAME

Test::Class::Sugar::Context - Pay no attention to the class behind the curtain

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Class::Sugar::Context does most of the heavy lifting for
Test::Class::Sugar's parser. No user serviceable parts inside and all that.

However, if you're writing your own module using L<Devel::Declare> and, like I
was, you're looking at other D::D client modules to lift ideas from, then you
probably want to take a look at the following selected methods:

=over

=item B<looking_at($expected, $len)>

Look at the unparsed buffer and returns true if it
matches C<$expected>. Given a C<$len> argument, looking_at first makes sure
that there are at least $len characters in the buffer.

=item B<get_buffer>, B<set_buffer>

Getters and setters. Like B<get_linestr> and B<set_linestr> but, rather than
return the whole C<linestr>, they only return the unparsed bit of it. If you
too are sick of writing C<< substr($ctx->get_linestr, $ctx->offset) >>, then
these are the methods for you.

=item B<alter_buffer(CODE)>

It works like this:

    $ctx->alter_buffer(sub { s/bibble// }

Obvious no?

B<alter_buffer> temporarily copies the buffer into C<$_>, then calls the
coderef you pass in, then writes the new value of C<$_> back into the
buffer. It's not quite the same as having a fully mutable buffer, but it'll
just have to serve.

=item B<extend_buffer>

Grabs the next linestr and appends it to the buffer.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Only kidding. Right now the diagnostics suck harder than a thing that sucks
very hard indeed. One of these days I'll work out how to have a parser fail
gracefully with meaningful diagnostics, but today is not that day.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There's bound to be some. Patches welcome.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to me. It's unlikely you'll get any
response if you use L<http://rt.cpan.org> though. Your best course of action
is to fork the project L<http://www.github.com/pdcawley/test-class-sugar>,
write at least one failing test (Write something in C<testclass> form that
should work, but doesn't. If you can arrange for it to fail gracefully, then
please do, but if all you do is write something that blows up spectacularly,
that's good too. Failing/exploding tests are like manna to a maintenance
programmer.
