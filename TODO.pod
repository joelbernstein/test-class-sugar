=item Freer test naming

  test $thing->method should do something {
    ..
  }

should simply add a test called 'thing_method_should_do_something' to the test
class.

Meanwhile

  foreach my $method (qw/subject body/) {
    test "responds to $method" {
      ok $self->{instance}->$method();
    }
  }

should generate a couple of tests in the obvious way. Variables should be
interpolated in double quoted strings, not otherwise.

=item Policy stuff

  use Test::Class::Sugar (
    -default_prefix => 'MyTest::Suite::',
    -test_instance  => '$self',
  );

  testclass exercises SomeClass {
    test policy changes {
      ok $self->isa('MyTest::Suite::SomeClass');
    }
  }

=item Anonymous tests

Sometimes assertion comments are enough:

  test {
    ok 1, "I prefer to name my tests like this";
  }

=item Better diagnostics

Right now, when things fail, they fail spectacularly. Okay if you don't fuck
up, not so okay otherwise. Make the parser fail gracefully.

=item Preserve the correct linenumber

No idea how to do this yet...
